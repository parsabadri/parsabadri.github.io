        <h3>Key technologies</h3>
        <ul class="details-list">
          <li>
            <strong>React.js</strong>: The application is built using React.js,
            a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's
            component-based architecture allows for modular, reusable
            components, ensuring efficient development and maintenance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Redux</strong>: For state management, Redux is integrated to
            handle complex application state, providing a predictable state
            container and enabling consistent behavior across different
            components.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>React Router</strong>: Utilized for client-side routing,

            component-specific styles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Axios</strong>: Axios is employed for making HTTP requests
            to the backend API, handling data fetching, and ensuring robust
            error handling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MaterialUI</strong>: The beautiful and user-friendly UI
            library by google, partially used in the user interface of the web
            application.
